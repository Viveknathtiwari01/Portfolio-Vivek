AboutAbout
I’m a dynamic Full Stack Developer and aspiring AI/ML Engineer, currently in the final year of my MCA. With hands-on experience in MERN stack development and ongoing AI/ML training, I bring a strong foundation across both software development and data-driven technologies.

I completed a 6-month paid internship as a Full Stack Developer, where I focused on building responsive web applications and scalable backend systems. Prior to that, I undertook 3 months of dedicated training in Python Django, which strengthened my skills in backend development and API integration.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into AI and Machine Learning through practical training, working on projects involving data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and intelligent system deployment.


Driven by curiosity and a passion for solving complex problems, I thrive in collaborative environments where continuous learning and innovation are encouraged. I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities in Full Stack Development, Data Analytics, or AI/ML Engineering, where I can contribute meaningfully and grow alongside a future-forward team.
